The **CASSINI Hackathon** is a pan-European space entrepreneurship competition funded by the **European Commission**, designed to turn space technologies and Earth-observation data into real-world, commercially viable solutions.

In this edition of the hackathon, teams from **10 European nations** competed simultaneously across Europe. I represented **Bulgaria** with the idea of Avalanche Detectors.

Over an intensive **72-hour** period, we were required to design, integrate, and present a complete end-to-end solution under strict time constraints. This included defining the technical architecture, selecting and using relevant Earth-observation data, and building a coherent business model aimed at addressing a concrete societal problem—real-time avalanche risk detection and decision support.

The project was evaluated by EU-level experts in space technologies, innovation, and entrepreneurship. At the conclusion of the competition, **AvMAP was ranked first**, earning recognition as the winning project and securing inclusion in the official **CASSINI Hackathon portfolio**.

This experience validated not only the technical direction of the project, but also my ability to execute under pressure in a highly competitive, international environment, translating complex space data into a clear and actionable system.
