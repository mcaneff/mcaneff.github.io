## Introduction

Welcome. This post lays the foundation for solving Lambertâ€™s Problem in orbital mechanicsâ€”a cornerstone question in mission planning and trajectory design.

> **The Core Question:**  
> *Given the position of a celestial body at two distinct times, can we determine the orbit it followed?*

More formally: *Can we determine the conic section (typically an ellipse) defined by two position vectors and the time of flight between them?*

This is Part I of a two-part series. Here, we focus on the physical intuition, Keplerian time relationships, and the geometric structure behind Lambertâ€™s Problem. In Part II, weâ€™ll derive and apply the full Lambert formulation.

  <summary><strong>Keplerâ€™s Equation</strong></summary>

A key component in solving Lambertâ€™s Problem is **Keplerâ€™s Equation**, which links time of flight to position via orbital anomalies:

$$
M = E - e\sin E \tag{1}
$$

Where:  
- \( M \) = **Mean Anomaly**  
- \( E \) = **Eccentric Anomaly**  
- \( e \) = **Eccentricity**

**Mean Anomaly:** Think of it as the angular position the body would have if it were moving uniformly in a circular orbit with the same period.

**Eccentric Anomaly:** The projection of the body's true position on the auxiliary circle that circumscribes the ellipse.  
{{< figure src="eccentric_anamoly.png" width="350px" caption="Eccentric anomaly" >}}

**Eccentricity:** A measure of how much an orbit deviates from circularity.  
- \( e = 0 \) â†’ perfect circle  
- \( 0 < e < 1 \) â†’ ellipse  
[See more on eccentricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity)

  <summary><strong>Worked Example</strong></summary>

Letâ€™s say we have:  
- Semi-major axis \( a = 10,000 \ \text{km} \)  
- \( t_1 = 0 \), \( t_2 = 2000 \ \text{s} \)  
- Eccentricity \( e = 0.2 \)

Compute Mean Anomaly:

$$
M = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}(t_2 - t_1)
$$

With \( \mu = 3.986 \times 10^{14} \ \text{m}^3/\text{s}^2 \):

$$
M = \sqrt{\frac{3.986 \times 10^{14}}{(10^7)^3}} \cdot 2000 \approx 1.261 \ \text{rad}
$$

## Time of Flight via Anomalies

To connect Keplerâ€™s Equation to Lambertâ€™s framework, we subtract two time-position relations:

$$
M = E - e\sin E
$$

Subtracting between two points:

$$
M_2 - M_1 = (E_2 - e\sin E_2) - (E_1 - e\sin E_1)
$$

Now replace Mean Anomaly with time:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}(t_2 - t_1) = (E_2 - e\sin E_2) - (E_1 - e\sin E_1)
$$

This is the first key equation: it expresses the time of flight purely in terms of **eccentric anomalies**.

## Radius and Eccentric Anomaly Relationship

We want to move from anomaly-based expressions to ones based on known quantities like position vectors. This helps later when we donâ€™t know the anomalies.

A key identity:

$$
r = a(1 - e\cos E)
$$

This connects radius \( r \) at any point to the semi-major axis and eccentric anomaly.

## A Transcendental Form of Lambertâ€™s Equation

Using:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}(t_2 - t_1) = (E_2 - e\sin E_2) - (E_1 - e\sin E_1)
$$

And replacing each \( E \) using:

$$
E = \cos^{-1} \left(\frac{a - r}{ae}\right)
$$

We arrive at:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{a^3}}(t_2 - t_1) &= 
\left[ \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a - r_2}{ae} \right) - e\sin\left( \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{a - r_2}{ae} \right) \right) \right] \\
&- \left[ \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{a - r_1}{ae} \right) - e\sin\left( \cos^{-1}\left( \frac{a - r_1}{ae} \right) \right) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

While solvable with brute force, this form is not practical. A geometric method is more insightfulâ€”and more elegant.

## Geometric Constraints of the Transfer Orbit

{{< figure src="Geometric_Property_of_Elipses.png" width="350px" caption="Geometric Property of Ellipses" >}}

Every ellipse has two foci. For an orbit, one is occupied by the central body (e.g., Earth). The otherâ€”**the vacant focus**â€”plays a crucial role in determining the transfer orbit.

The ellipse obeys a key property:

> The sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci equals \( 2a \), the major axis length.

So:

$$
P_1F + P_1F' = 2a
$$

Or more concretely:

$$
r_1 + (2a - r_1) = 2a
$$

You can visualize this with:

{{< figure src="Geometric_Proof_of_Elipses.png" width="550px" caption="Geometric proof of ellipses using design software." >}}

Now consider how we locate that second focus geometrically. If we fix points \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \), and draw circles of constant radius from them, the **intersections of those circles** represent potential positions for the vacant focus. Each such point defines a valid elliptical transfer.

{{< figure src="Search_for_SMA.png" width="550px" caption="Search for semi-major axis via geometric intersections." >}}

At each intersection, there exists a possible ellipse passing through \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) with the appropriate focal configuration.

> When the two circles touch at **exactly one point**, this corresponds to the **minimum energy transfer** orbit.

{{< figure src="Optomal_Energy_Transfer.png" width="550px" caption="Optimal energy transfer orbit when vacant focus lies on P1-P2 chord." >}}

This orbit requires the **least delta-v**, but **not necessarily the shortest time**. Among all transfer orbits satisfying Lambertâ€™s constraints, the most circular one (least eccentric) tends to be the most efficient energetically.

<details open>
  <summary><strong>Why the Vacant Focus Lies on the Chord</strong></summary>

The minimal-energy ellipse has its secondary focus lying directly on the chord connecting \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \). This minimizes the ellipseâ€™s eccentricity and thus the required velocity change.

In Part II, weâ€™ll use this geometric constraint, combined with orbital mechanics principles, to derive the full Lambert formulation.
