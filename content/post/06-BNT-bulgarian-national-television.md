I was featured on **Bulgarian National Television (BNT)** in a segment focused on **real-time avalanche detection** and the development of **AvMAP (Avalanche Detectors)**.

The feature explored how satellite Earth-observation data can be used to monitor avalanche-prone terrain and support better decision-making for mountaineers, ski resorts, and rescue services. I discussed the technical approach behind AvMAP, including the motivation for the project and its potential societal relevance in improving safety in mountainous regions.

The segment presented the project to a national audience, highlighting the intersection between space technology, applied engineering, and public safety.
