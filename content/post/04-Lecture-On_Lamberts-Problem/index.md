### Background

This post contains a lecture I delivered to my colleagues at Sofia University.

Inspired by the real-world applications of Lambert's Problem in lunar and interplanetary transfers, I structured this material to cover both the theoretical foundations and the numerical methods required to solve it. The lecture includes derivations, Kepler’s equation extensions, historical context, and a practical implementation for an Earth-to-Moon mission using a ∆V-constrained trajectory.

### Key Takeaways from the Lecture

- Full derivation of Lambert’s equation from geometric and anomaly-based methods
- Historical evolution: From Lambert and Lagrange to Gauss and modern numerical solvers
- Application: Transfer trajectory planning with ∆V constraints and lunar orbit targeting
- Implementation: Code-ready parameters modeled after Apollo mission architecture
- Tools: Applied in FreeFlyer with contextual mission planning using a porkchop plot subset
