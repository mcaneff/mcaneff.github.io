I was invited to participate in a public podcast discussion focused on **space-enabled innovation**, entrepreneurship, and the development of **AvMAP (Avalanche Detectors)** in the context of the **CASSINI Hackathon**.

The conversation covered the practical realities of building and presenting a technically grounded project under extreme time constraints, including the challenges of integrating Earth-observation data, system design, and a viable business model. We also discussed the broader role of European space initiatives in supporting early-stage technical innovation and translating research into real-world applications.

The format allowed for a long-form, reflective discussion on execution, decision-making under pressure, and the intersection of engineering and entrepreneurship in the space sector.
