I was invited to **Bulgarian National Radio (BNR – Horizont)** to discuss the CASSINI Hackathon and the development of **AvMAP (Avalanche Detectors)** in the context of rapid innovation and execution under extreme time constraints.

The conversation focused on what it takes to move from a technical idea to a coherent, sellable system within a **72-hour** competitive environment. We discussed the integration of technical architecture, Earth-observation data, and business logic, as well as the practical and entrepreneurial challenges of building under pressure.

The interview also covered the broader role of European space initiatives in enabling early-stage innovation and the importance of translating advanced technology into solutions with real societal impact.
