I'm Michael—an engineer, graduate student, and passionate learner in the fields of aerospace and 3D design. My journey is guided by curiosity and a desire to explore the boundaries of innovation. With a strong foundation in engineering and a love for discovery, I aim to bridge the gap between imagination and reality by developing tools like a planetary dynamics visualizer that transforms abstract orbital mechanics concepts into interactive, tangible models.

#### My Journey So Far

Having earned my bachelor's degree in Engineering Science with a focus on Computer Engineering from the University of Western Ontario, I am now pursuing a master's degree in Aerospace Engineering at Sofia University to deepen my understanding of aerospace systems and rocket science. My work and studies focus on learning about spacecraft technologies, exploring their potential for human space exploration, and understanding the challenges that come with such ambitious endeavors.

Professionally, I have three years of experience at Cisco Systems, where I specialize in developing software solutions using C++ and Swift. I work on the WebEx platform backend at Cisco Systems, focusing on Voice over IP (VoIP) technologies. My role involves integrating new telemetry into the product to better track call performance metrics such as jitter, call drop times, call setup times, and round-trip times. I work extensively with SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol), which are essential for initiating, maintaining, and delivering VoIP communications. These protocols enable reliable call setup, audio and video transmission, and overall system performance.

In my free time, I enjoy track sprinting, focusing on the 60, 100, and 200 meters, which helps me stay disciplined and active outside of work. I’m also exploring 3D printing as a way to better integrate my passion for rockets with my current engineering knowledge. For example, I recently started designing a modular rocket fin assembly in Fusion 360, focusing on optimizing its structure for both strength and ease of manufacturing.

#### My Skills and Interests

Aerospace Engineering: Learning about systems that endure the challenges of space and support humanity's boldest missions.

3D Design & Printing: Combining creativity with engineering principles to explore topological maps, mechanical parts, and more.

Software Development: Proficient in C++ and Swift, focusing on efficient and reliable software solutions.

Problem-Solving: From calibrating my Ender 3 3D printer to exploring orbital mechanics, I enjoy tackling challenges step by step.

#### What Drives Me

I believe in embracing challenges and viewing them as opportunities for growth. My goal is to balance academic achievements, professional growth, and personal development, always seeking progress.

#### Current Projects

Developing a planetary dynamics visualizer to bring orbital mechanics to life.

Experimenting with 3D-printed topological maps and functional designs.

Building this personal portfolio to showcase my work and reflect my journey.

Exploring aerospace systems and their potential for future applications.

#### Beyond Work

When I'm not immersed in engineering or 3D design, you'll find me training as a track sprinter, racing in sailing regattas, or working on building better habits and mastering new skills step by step.
