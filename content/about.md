I'm Michael—an engineer and graduate student with a passion for aerospace and 3D design. I enjoy solving problems, whether through software development, mechanical design, or exploring orbital mechanics. My work and studies focus on understanding spacecraft technologies and their role in space exploration.

#### Background
I earned my bachelor's degree in Engineering Science with a focus on Computer Engineering from the University of Western Ontario and am currently pursuing a master's in Aerospace Engineering at Sofia University. I also work at Cisco Systems, specializing in VoIP technologies and software development in C++ and Swift.

#### Interests & Projects
- **Aerospace Engineering** – Exploring spacecraft systems and their potential applications.
- **3D Design & Printing** – Creating mechanical parts, topological maps, and experimental models.
- **Software Development** – Building efficient and reliable solutions.

#### Outside of Work
I stay active through track sprinting and hiking, always looking for ways to challenge myself and improve. I also enjoy learning new skills and working on personal projects that blend engineering and creativity.
